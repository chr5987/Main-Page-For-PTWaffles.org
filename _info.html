        <h1>Positioning elements with Flexbox is easy</h1>
        <p>CSS gets a lot of criticism for how difficult it is to do simple design tasks, such as positioning an element in the center of its parent.</p>
        <p>This used to be true many years ago. But CSS has improved a lot in recent years. Flexbox makes it very easy to position a child element in relation to its parent.</p>
        <h2>The example layout</h2>
        <p>The example layout has a <code data-pginfo-select="body">body</code> with a fullscreen background image an a <code data-pginfo-select="div">div</code> box with some placeholder text.</p>
        <p>We are positioning the <code data-pginfo-select="div">div</code> box in relation to its <code data-pginfo-select="body">body</code> parent element.</p>
        <h2>Try it</h2>
        <p>Play around and place the box in different places.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the <span></span>
                <code><span data-pginfo-select="body">bod</span><span>y</span></code>
                <span></span> element. Flexbox layout is defined on the parent (container) element.
            </li>
            <li>Go to the <b>Style panel</b>.
            </li>
            <li>Jump to the <b>Flex Container</b>&nbsp;section.
            </li>
            <li>There use <b>Align items</b> and <b>Justify content</b> properties to control the vertical and horizontal placement of children elements (the div box in our case).
            </li>
            <li>Note that by default Flexbox layout is organized in a column. Selecting <b>Flex direction</b> row would reverse the meaning of above properties.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Too much to remember? Use the AI Assistant to move the box for you.</h2>
        <p>Moving divs around is a hard job. Let&apos;s be super cool and have our AI Assistant do the heavy lifting:</p>
        <p>Select the <code data-pginfo-select="body">body</code> element, as before and ask the AI Assistant to:</p>
        <div data-pginfo-ai>Position the child element in the top left corner.</div>
        <div data-pginfo-ai>Position the child element in the center.</div>
        <div data-pginfo-ai>Position the child element to the right, stretch it from top to bottom.</div>
        <div data-pginfo-ai data-pginfo-ai-action="content">Make a joke about positioning elements with Flexbox.</div>
    </body>
